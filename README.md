#videoanalytiikka frontend

## Install:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ gulp
```

Frontend depends on jQuery and Mustache.

Gulp, Babel and gulp-babel are used to translate ES6 when developing. Running gulp creates dist/app.js and launches watch that checks app.js for changes.

## Run

Frontend is a simple web page that doesn't require anything special to be run once the install section has been done.
