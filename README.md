## Install:

`$ npm install`
`$ bower install`

Frontend depends on jQuery and Mustache. Gulp and gulp-babel are used to translate ES6 when developing.

## Run

Frontend is a simple web page that doesn't require anything special to be run.

## Develop

`$ gulp`

Gulp runs watch by default and checkes app.js for changes.
